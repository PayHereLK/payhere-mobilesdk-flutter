# PayHere Flutter SDK

Integrating PayHere with your Flutter App is super easy with our PayHere Flutter SDK. You just have to include the package in your project dependencies, call its methods to initiate a payment and fetch the payment status just after the payment. The beauty is, this SDK allows you to accept a payment within your app, without redirecting your app user to the web browser.

## Usage ##

### 1. Include PayHere Mobile SDK in your App ###

Open your Flutter project's `pubspec.yaml` file and add the PayHere Flutter SDK dependency.
```yaml
dependencies:
  payhere_mobilesdk_flutter: ^3.0.4
```

Then run the following commands in your Flutter project directory.

```
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Android Pre-requisites ###

##### a. Add the PayHere Android SDK's Maven repository #####

Open up the (outermost) `build.gradle` file in your Android project and add the repository. 

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        maven {
            url  "https://repo.repsy.io/mvn/payhere/payhere-mobilesdk-android/"
        }
    }
}

```
##### b. Allow Manifest attribute merge  #####

Open up the `AndroidManifest.xml` file in your Anrdoid project and make the following changes.

i. Declare the Android `tools` namespace in the `<manifest>` element.
```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.domain.name"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">
```

ii. Add the `replace` merge rule for the `android:label` attribute in the `<application>` element.
```xml
<application tools:replace="android:label">
```

### 3. iOS Pre-requisites ###

Run the following command in your iOS Project.
```
pod install
```

### 4. Whitelist Mobile App Package Name ###

a. Login to your PayHere Merchant Account and navigate to Integrations.

b. Click the 'Add Domain/App' button.

c. Select 'App' from the first dropdown.

d. Add your Flutter App package name (e.g. lk.bhasha.helakuru).

e. Take note of the hash value in the last field. This is your Merchant Secret for this specific mobile App.

f. Click 'Request to Approve'. 

> If you are using a PayHere Live Merchant Account, your App Package Name must be manually reviewed by our operations team. Please allow upto a day for this review process to complete.

### 5. Initiate a Payment Request to PayHere Payment Gateway ### 

##### a. One-time Payment Request #####

Creates a one-time payment request charged only once. To capture the payment details from your server, [read our docs](https://support.payhere.lk/api-&-mobile-sdk/payhere-checkout#2-listening-to-payment-notification).

```dart
import 'package:payhere_mobilesdk_flutter/payhere_mobilesdk_flutter.dart';

Map paymentObject = {
  "sandbox": true,                 // true if using Sandbox Merchant ID
  "merchant_id": "1211149",        // Replace your Merchant ID
  "notify_url": "https://ent13zfovoz7d.x.pipedream.net/",
  "order_id": "ItemNo12345",
  "items": "Hello from Flutter!",
  "amount": 50.00,
  "currency": "LKR",
  "first_name": "Saman",
  "last_name": "Perera",
  "email": "samanp@gmail.com",
  "phone": "0771234567",
  "address": "No.1, Galle Road",
  "city": "Colombo",
  "country": "Sri Lanka",
  "delivery_address": "No. 46, Galle road, Kalutara South",
  "delivery_city": "Kalutara",
  "delivery_country": "Sri Lanka",
  "custom_1": "",
  "custom_2": ""
};

PayHere.startPayment(
  paymentObject, (paymentId) {
    print("One Time Payment Success. Payment Id: $paymentId");
  }, (error) { 
    print("One Time Payment Failed. Error: $error");
  }, () { 
    print("One Time Payment Dismissed");
  }
);
```

##### b. Recurring Payment Request #####

Creates a subscription payment that is charged at a fixed frequency. To capture the payment details from your server, [read our docs](https://support.payhere.lk/api-&-mobile-sdk/payhere-recurring#2-listening-to-payment-notification).

Read more about Recurring Payments [in our docs](https://support.payhere.lk/faq/recurring-billing).

```dart
import 'package:payhere_mobilesdk_flutter/payhere_mobilesdk_flutter.dart';

Map paymentObject = {
  "sandbox": true,                 // true if using Sandbox Merchant ID
  "merchant_id": "1211149",        // Replace your Merchant ID
  "notify_url": "https://ent13zfovoz7d.x.pipedream.net/",
  "order_id": "ItemNo12345",
  "items": "Hello from Flutter!",
  "amount": 100.00,
  "recurrence": "1 Month",        // Recurring payment frequency
  "duration": "1 Year",           // Recurring payment duration
  "currency": "LKR",
  "first_name": "Saman",
  "last_name": "Perera",
  "email": "samanp@gmail.com",
  "phone": "0771234567",
  "address": "No.1, Galle Road",
  "city": "Colombo",
  "country": "Sri Lanka",
  "delivery_address": "No. 46, Galle road, Kalutara South",
  "delivery_city": "Kalutara",
  "delivery_country": "Sri Lanka",
  "custom_1": "",
  "custom_2": ""
};

PayHere.startPayment(
  paymentObject, (paymentId) {
    print("Recurring Payment Success. Payment Id: $paymentId");
  }, (error) { 
    print("Recurring Payment Failed. Error: $error");
  }, () { 
    print("Recurring Payment Dismissed");
  }
);
```

##### c. Preapproval Request #####

Tokenize customer card details for later usage with the [PayHere Charging API](https://support.payhere.lk/api-&-mobile-sdk/payhere-charging). To capture the payment details from your server, [read our docs](https://support.payhere.lk/api-&-mobile-sdk/payhere-preapproval#2-listening-to-payment-notification).

Read more about Automated Charging [in our docs](https://support.payhere.lk/faq/automated-charging).  

> __NOTE:__ Since version 3.0.4 you can pass an 'amount' parameter in the pre-approval request. If this is omitted the customer will only be pre-approved. If an amount is provided, it will be charged from the customer during pre-approval. In both scenarios a `customer_token` will still be generated.

```dart
import 'package:payhere_mobilesdk_flutter/payhere_mobilesdk_flutter.dart';

Map paymentObject = {
  "sandbox": true,                 // true if using Sandbox Merchant ID
  "preapprove": true,              // Required
  "merchant_id": "1211149",        // Replace your Merchant ID
  "notify_url": "http://sample.com/notify",
  "order_id": "ItemNo12345",
  "items": "Hello from Flutter!",
  "currency": "LKR",
  "first_name": "Saman",
  "last_name": "Perera",
  "email": "samanp@gmail.com",
  "phone": "0771234567",
  "address": "No.1, Galle Road",
  "city": "Colombo",
  "country": "Sri Lanka",
  "amount": 30.00                   // Optional. An amount to pass while pre-approving.
};

PayHere.startPayment(
  paymentObject, (paymentId) {
    print("Tokenization Payment Success. Payment Id: $paymentId");
  }, (error) { 
    print("Tokenization Payment Failed. Error: $error");
  }, () { 
    print("Tokenization Payment Dismissed");
  }
);
```

##### d. Hold-on-Card Request #####

Authorize (hold) charges on a customer's card for later use with the [PayHere Capture API](https://support.payhere.lk/api-&-mobile-sdk/payhere-capture). To capture the payment hold details from your server, [read out docs](https://support.payhere.lk/api-&-mobile-sdk/payhere-authorize#2-listening-to-authorization-notification).

Read more about Hold-on-card [in our docs](https://support.payhere.lk/faq/hold-on-card).  

```dart
import 'package:payhere_mobilesdk_flutter/payhere_mobilesdk_flutter.dart';

Map paymentObject = {
  "sandbox": true,                // true if using Sandbox Merchant ID
  "authorize": true,              // Required
  "merchant_id": "1211149",       // Replace your Merchant ID
  "notify_url": "https://ent13zfovoz7d.x.pipedream.net/",
  "order_id": "ItemNo12345",
  "items": "Hello from Flutter!",
  "currency": "LKR",
  "amount": "50.00",
  "first_name": "Saman",
  "last_name": "Perera",
  "email": "samanp@gmail.com",
  "phone": "0771234567",
  "address": "No.1, Galle Road",
  "city": "Colombo",
  "country": "Sri Lanka",
};

PayHere.startPayment(paymentObject, (paymentId) {
  print("Hold-on-Card Payment Success.");
}, (error) {
  print("Hold-on-Card Payment Failed. Error: $error");
}, () {
  print("Hold-on-Card Payment Dismissed");
});
```

### 6. Optionally, pass Item-wise Details

Starting with version `2.0.0` you can optionally pass the details of the line items in the order. These details will appear in the customer's invoice. Item-wise Details are supported in Onetime, Subscription and Authorization payment modes. It is not supported in Pre-approval payments.

Each item has four parameters. Their parameter names must be followed by the index of that item. For example:
```json
  "item_number_1": "ITM001",
  "item_name_1": "PayHere Sticker",
  "quantity_1": "2",
  "amount_1": "25.0",
```

An example Onetime payment request with 2 items is shown below. If you have specific questions, please raise them in the [Issues section](https://github.com/PayHereDevs/payhere-mobilesdk-flutter/issues).

```dart
import 'package:payhere_mobilesdk_flutter/payhere_mobilesdk_flutter.dart';

Flutter versions above `1.20.0` are supported.

#### What versions of iOS are supported? ####

The iOS component for this SDK supports iOS Versions above 11.0.

#### What versions of Android are supported?

The Android component for this SDK supports Android Versions above API Level 17.

#### What are the parameters for the `PayHere.startPayment` method? ####

```dart
PayHere.startPayment(
  paymentObject, 
  onCompletedHandler,
  onErrorHandler,
  onDismissedHandler
);
```

- `paymentObject` - _Object_

#### How to get payment details such as payment method, status, card holder etc.?

You must setup a Server Endpoint that accepts the asynchronous PayHere Payment Notification `POST` request, and pass its URL to the `notify_url` parameter of the `paymentObject`. 

Each payment request type (one-time/recurring/pre-approval) sends a different payment notification. Study the following sections for more information.

- One-time Payment Details: [read docs](https://support.payhere.lk/api-&-mobile-sdk/payhere-checkout#2-listening-to-payment-notification)
- Recurring Payment Details: [read docs](https://support.payhere.lk/api-&-mobile-sdk/payhere-recurring#2-listening-to-payment-notification)
- Preapproval Details: [read docs](https://support.payhere.lk/api-&-mobile-sdk/payhere-preapproval#2-listening-to-preapproval-notification)
- Authorization (Hold) Details: [read docs](https://support.payhere.lk/api-&-mobile-sdk/payhere-authorize#2-listening-to-authorization-notification)

#### I am getting an error saying, "Could not GET 'https://dl.bintray.com..." ####

PayHere Flutter Native SDK versions prior to 1.0.2 (1.0.1 and previous versions) depended on an older version of the PayHere Android SDK which is no longer available through the bintray.com Maven repository. Update to the latest version 1.0.2 and try again.

If you are still experiencing issues, make sure you have followed the new "2. Android Pre-requisites" section with updated instructions for SDK versions 1.0.2 and above.

#### I am getting a runtime error in iOS saying, "PayHere Bundle could not be found!"

To fix the issue, open the "./ios/Podfile" file. Find the line that says "use_modular_headers!". Above it, add the "use_frameworks!" line as shown below.

```ruby
target 'Runner' do
  # Add this line
  use_frameworks!
  use_modular_headers!

  flutter_install_all_ios_pods File.dirname(File.realpath(__FILE__))
end
```

Clean and re-build your project and the issue should be resolved.

#### Does this package support Flutter Null Safety?

Yes! Version 1.0.3 and up opts into Flutter Null Safety. 

If you are creating a new Flutter project, you will experience no issues. If you have project that you are planning to upgrade to Flutter 2 / migrate to Flutter Null Safety, there are no changes to be done in code other than updating to the latest version.

#### Can I pass details about each item in the Order?

Yes! Starting from version `2.0.0`, the PayHere Flutter SDK supports Item-wise Parameters. Please read [Section 6](https://github.com/PayHereLK/payhere-mobilesdk-flutter#6-optionally-pass-item-wise-details) above.

#### Does this SDK support Payment Authorization (Hold on Card) and Capture?

Yes and No. Starting from version `2.0.0` this SDK supports Authorization (also known as Hold on Card) requests. Authorizations generate an `authorization_token` which is sent as a POST request to your `notify_url`. 

From there you must use the [PayHere Capture API](https://support.payhere.lk/api-&-mobile-sdk/payhere-capture) to use the genereated token and perform the capture. You can read more about the PayHere Hold on Card Feature by [reading our docs](https://support.payhere.lk/faq/hold-on-card).

#### I have a different question. Where should I raise my issues? ####

1. You can raise issues directly at the [Issues section](https://github.com/PayHereDevs/payhere-mobilesdk-flutter/issues) for the SDK's GitHub page.
2. You can contact a PayHere Developer for technical support by mailing your issue and relevant code/screenshots to [techsupport@payhere.lk](mailto:techsupport@payhere.lk)
